# 💰 Predicting User Spending on Website vs Mobile App  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to analyze and predict user spending across two digital platforms: **website** and **mobile app**.  
The goal is to uncover spending patterns, understand user behavior, and provide **data-driven insights** to improve marketing strategies and optimize platform performance.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze user data to identify key factors affecting spending.  
- Build and evaluate a **Linear Regression model** to predict spending.  
- Compare spending trends between the website and mobile app.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to support business decisions.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values.  
- Performed **feature selection** to improve model efficiency.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyzed spending trends across **website vs mobile app**.  
- Visualized correlations and feature distributions.  

### 3. Model Development  
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing sets**.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression model**.  
- Fine-tuned parameters for better predictive accuracy.  

### 4. Model Evaluation  
- **R² Score** – explained variance of spending predictions.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – average prediction error.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – penalized large errors.  

### 5. Visualization  
- Spending distribution plots.  
- Regression line fits.  
- Feature correlations using **Seaborn heatmaps**.

## ✅ Results & Insights  
- The model achieved a **high R² score**, showing strong predictive power.  
- Spending patterns differ between **website and mobile app** users.  
- Identified key drivers of spending: session length, time spent on app vs website, and engagement levels.  
- Provided **actionable insights** to guide marketing and investment in the most profitable platform.
